# AISpamShield

## Overview
AISpamShield is an advanced email spam filter built using a range of machine learning techniques. It aims to efficiently classify incoming emails into "spam" or "ham" (legitimate) categories and move them into the appropriate folders. The project includes a Flask-based web interface for easy user interactions.

## Features
- IMAP support for email fetching.
- Basic to advanced machine learning models for spam classification.
- User-friendly web interface to input IMAP credentials and folder selection.
- Ensemble methods for improved performance.
- Real-time metrics and reporting.
- Continuous learning capabilities.
- Extensive documentation and open-source.

## Roadmap
### Phase 1: Initial Setup & Data Collection
- [ ] IMAP connection to email account.
- [ ] Create folders in email for "ham" and "spam."
- [ ] Collect historical emails for training data.

### Phase 2: Basic Spam Filter
- [ ] Implement a simple machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes).
- [ ] Test and move emails based on prediction.
